# Yeet
So this plugin is about launching players around,  :)

- The (x) (y) (z) is the force and direction axix, i wouldnt go for values much higher than 5 as the server usually reverts the movement however feel free to experiment


There are 2 commands, /yeet and /yeetstick

- You can either do /yeet (player) (x) (y) (z) OR /yeet (x) (y) (z)  which will yeet yourself

- You can also get a yeetstick, so when you hit players with it they will go flying in whatever direction you set,

/yeetstick (x) (y) (z)

# Permissions
- By default only ops have these permissions
- The Yeet command requires the "yeet.cmd" permission
- the yeetstick command requires the "yeet.stick" permisson
- The yeetstick will only work for people who have the "yeetstick.use" permission,
